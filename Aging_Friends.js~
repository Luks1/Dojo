 I have to store the statement in to an string first
 Then I have to remove "is" and replace it with ":" using the replace method
 And then I have to store it in an array using split
 Then I have to loop through the array using for each
 And then store each person as an object.

var myStrings = "Xola is 23, Peter is 18, Oya is 29, Ellie is 20, Sive is 27";

//spliting myStrings first automatically goes to array also
var strings = myStrings.split(",");

//logging out my strings will be on array
    //console.log(strngs);
//
// var fixedStrngs = myStrings
// .replace(/is/g, ":");
// console.log(fixedStrngs);

secondString = [];

 strings.forEach(function(names){
   secondString.push(names.split("is"));

});
console.log(secondString);
